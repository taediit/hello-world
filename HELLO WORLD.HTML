        <p> Thank you for visitng my first webpage. Let me introduce myself, my name is Tay. Nice to meet you!</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am 27 years old, pursuing a new career in coding. For most of my life I have only <em>fairly</em> dabbled in 
            computer science but decided to take my passion to medical sciences.</p>
        <p> After many years of work in that field, I migrated to the US, and finally decided to take my passion to this field, 
            having always being interested it did not take much push to find a online certification course to begin my journey!
